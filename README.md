## Usage

**Important: network requests sent between your iPhone and PC are currently unsecured. Only use Linkdrop if you are on a trusted network (like a home network).**

Linkdrop works by creating a local server on your PC which your iPhone can send requests to. 
1. Make sure your iPhone and PC are connected to the same network.
2. On your PC, allow incoming URLs by clicking "Get URL", or paste a URL to send to your iPhone.
3. Run either shortcut from your iPhone. You may be asked to fill out the IP address or port of your PC; if so, refer to the Server IP shown on the PC.
